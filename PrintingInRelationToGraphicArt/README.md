# Bookstyler: a paged.js starter kit

The bookstyler starter-kit contains everything you need to make a book with paged.js

You can install and test it like this:

1. Install node.js if you haven't already.
1. create a folder and open a terminal inside it. Clone the repo there, using `git clone https://gitlab.pagedmedia.org/julientaq/bookstyler.git`
1. install grunt with `npm install -g grunt-cli`
1. run `npm install` inside the cloned folder 
1. run `grunt` in the terminal and browse the `localhost:9000` in chrome or chromium.



## Prerequisites 

Bookstyler use postcss plugins to handle nested css, import files, some colors functions, etc. If that's too complicated, you can use real css in a simple file, and not worry about postcs.

When you run `grunt`, it will look at the content of your src folder and copy everything in the images, fonts, js, and content folders while processing the css to transform it into a single file.

That's why you only need to add this link to the html: 
`<link href="css/book.css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">`


## Road map

- add styles and update the existing stylesheet
- add pug/jade/etc. support to handle multiple html preprocessor

Version 0.0.5
